      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Threads of Minds began in 2024 when a group of London, Ontario teens decided to protect their community from Alzheimer’s disease through awareness, creativity, and compassion.</p>

          <span class="badge">Why we started</span>
          <p>We witnessed friends and relatives face the relentless progression of Alzheimer’s. Those experiences inspired us to take action: to educate neighbours, honour caregivers, and fundraise for research with meaningful apparel that sparks conversation.</p>
          <p>Threads of Minds is entirely student-led. Every design, fact sheet, and event is crafted after school hours with one goal in mind—<span class="highlight">raising awareness that protects as many people as possible</span>.</p>

          <h2>What Threads of Minds Represents</h2>
          <p>The “Threads” symbolize the clothing we design to spark conversations. “Minds” reflects the communities we are protecting from the memory loss caused by Alzheimer’s disease. Put together, the name celebrates how awareness can stitch together families, friends, and support systems.</p>
          <p>We also see threads as the brain’s synapses—delicate connections that need care. As our garments are woven, so too are the networks of people ready to prevent and manage Alzheimer’s.</p>

        <span class="badge">Our promise</span>
        <h2>Mission First—Always</h2>
        <p>Threads of Minds exists solely to raise awareness. Merchandise profits cover production costs and education materials; we do not take personal profit. Every purchase and conversation fuels a community that guards memories, uplifts caregivers, and funds research.</p>
