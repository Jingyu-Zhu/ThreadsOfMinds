# Threads of Minds (static recreation)

This repository contains a static recreation of https://www.threadsofminds.ca/ so that the site can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html` - landing page with hero, overview, and outreach gallery.
- `info.html` - statistics, preventative measures, caregiver impacts, and references.
- `action.html` - early warning signs and daily lifestyle tips.
- `about.html` - founding story, outreach highlights, and mission statement.
- `more.html` - curated list of external Alzheimer's organizations to support.
- `terms.html` - donation guidance and campaign call-to-action (mirrors the live Terms & Conditions page).
- `privacy.html` - detailed privacy policy reproduced from the live site.
- `assets/css/styles.css` - shared styling.
- `assets/images/` - images mirrored from the original Wix site.

## Getting started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to review the site locally.
3. Publish by pushing the repository to GitHub and enabling **GitHub Pages** (Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from branch -> `main`, root).

## Notes

- Fonts load from Google Fonts at runtime; no build step is required.
- External donation links point to the Alzheimer's Association (`alz.org`) until a dedicated donation page is available.
- Terms & privacy content matches the live Wix site and is linked from every page footer.
